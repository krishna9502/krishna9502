## EE-769 FINAL PROJECT

 * A program to implement multiprocessing feature in Convolutional Neural Network training for recognizing hand written digits in MNIST Database.

 * Most of the modules used are contained in Anaconda 3 distribution and also use Gunicorn module to run app.py

 * Main program to be run is train.py which starts training from the MNIST Dataset.

 * app.py is an app to test the prediction performance.

 * convnet.py implements the forward and back propagation for a single image and contains sections of code that took most time to run, which can be optimized further.
